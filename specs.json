    "description": "AgriCredit is an AI-Blockchain platform that bridges the gap between finance, sustainability, and agriculture across Africa. It provides decentralized microcredit access, an AI-powered marketplace, IoT-driven insights, and tokenized carbon credits, creating an integrated agri-economy for farmers, cooperatives, and investors.",
    "vision": "To build Africa’s first fully decentralized, AI-integrated financial ecosystem for agriculture.",
    "mission": "Empower African farmers and agribusinesses through trustless financial systems, data ownership, and AI-enabled insights.",
    "long_term_objective": "Enable millions of smallholder farmers to access fair credit, digital identities, and climate-smart incentives by 2030.",
    "impact_targets": [
      "Empower 10M farmers across 54 African countries",
      "Facilitate $500M in microloans via decentralized lending pools",
      "Digitize 50% of agri-credit transactions in rural communities",
